# odin-etch-a-sketch
I will be building a Etch-a-Sketch to demostrate my use of DOM. 
I believe this project will be challenging for me to complete because it require me to research and explore to new tools to use.
However, the end goal is to let the user to draw whatever they like on sketch, using various of colours. Page: https://not-tobi.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/
